Getting to know the keyboard

Find middle C.

The C not nearest the centre is the C key, next to two black keys.

It is generally just slightly left to the middle of your keyboard.

2. Next, notice the pattern of keys repeat themselves. Look at the black keys first.

There are twelve keys before each two black keys.

Try playing them.

Each of these groups of keys contain the same notes, but at different pitches.

3. Look at the C not again. Try a C note lower down the keybard (before the two black keys) 

Try the C notes further up the keyboard.

All the C notes are the same note, but at different pitches.

The same is true for each group of twelve keys.

The white keys are called A B C D E F G

Play first. Ask questions later

Don't move on until you have learnt all the white keys.

You know C comes before two black keys.

F is before three black keys.

G is after F.

If you know where C is, you can find B before the C key.

D is after C.

Then you will remember that D is between two black keys. That will also help.

G is the first gap of the three black keys.

A is the right hand gap of three black keys.

Use the black keys to guide you.

Octave is the distance from one note to the next note. That is twelve keys.

See if you can find the notes in each octave.

C for each octave.

B for each octave.

Don't move on until you have memorised the white keys.

The first black letter after a C is called a C#. It can also be called a D flat, since it is before a D. Sharp goes up. Flat goes done.

The next is D sharp. D sharp can be called a E flat.

You should now be able to name all the white keys and name all the black keys.
